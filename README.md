# Responsive Portfolio

This is my entry for the second week of howework. The ask here is to create a 3 page website with responsive buttons in a form of a navigation bar along with utilizing bootstrap and grid design (row, columns). The three pages consist of the main page (index), portfolio, and contact. The ask was also to keep in mind screen size and when the screen size is reduced to a smaller window, the items readjust accordingly. In the portfolio section the ask was to place your photos in a grid system, however, I experimented, and utilized bootstrap for a carousel.
